- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning something new every day, whether it's a new ML paper from surfing research Twitter or a new recipe to try out in the kitchen.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any exciting AI projects that push the boundaries of what machines can do!
- ðŸ¥… 2023 Goals: Lead my own research team and contribute more to Open Source projects. I want to help make AI more accessible to everyone!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing Tetris and watching anime. I also enjoy jamming out to K-pop and 88-rising music. And when I need a break from technology, I like to go on hikes and explore nature. ðŸŽ®ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ¸
