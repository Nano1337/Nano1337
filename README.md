### I'm an AI Researcher focusing on Multimodal Representation Learning and Data-Centric AI. I like solving complex real-world problems using cutting-edge AI. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring how we can curate better multimodal data foundationally (in academia) and at scale (at DatologyAI).  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning something new every day, whether it's a new ML paper from surfing research Twitter or a new recipe to try out in the kitchen.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any exciting AI projects that align with my research interests!
- ðŸ¥… 2024 Goals: Deeply understand how we can translate theoretical findings in multimodal training dynamics to multimodal data curation at scale.
